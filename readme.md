# Days of Coding Challenges

Day 0:

For the next few days, you'll receive a coding exercise every day by email. Frankly, this is an experiment to see if it helps improve your coding skills.

These are things that you should know how to do, perhaps with some effort.

These are exercises to improve your skills and build your confidence, not to be turned in and evaluated.  See how much you can do. If you get stuck, ask someone. Want to know if you got a "good" answer? Ask someone. Someone includes instructors, but it also includes the ever-growing community of coders/programmers/developers that you are a part of.
